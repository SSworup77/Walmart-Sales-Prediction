# Walmart Sales Prediction
 Using numpy, pandas, matplotlib and scikit learn

## Description
The project's aim is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model, Walmart authorities can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks, calculating revenue and deciding to make new investment or not.

With the accurate prediction company can;

1. Determine seasonal demands and take action for this
2. Protect from money loss because achieving sales targets can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions
3. Forecast revenue easily and accurately
4. Manage inventories
5. Do more effective campaigns

## Steps used in the project:
1. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Provides an idea about the data and makes it ready for future analysis
2. Feature engineering: Adding new features that using the given features and removing any of the unwanted features
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize data to understand trends, seasonality, and outliers.
4. Time-Series Analysis: Examine temporal patterns such as trends, seasonality, and cyclic behavior in sales data.
5. Data Preprocessing: Clean, transform, and prepare data for modeling, including handling missing values and scaling.
6. Data Modeling: Train machine learning models to predict sales based on historical data of the sales
